All platform-specific code for Hangskypetime can be found in the "Platform" folder for each platform project.

Within the "Platform" folder the "FromFM" subfolder contains "drop in" files copied from the Frozen Mountain examples for each platform for the VP8 and Opus Codecs. It is added here with permission from Frozen Mountain.

The sample was last built using the 2.8.9 version of the IceLink Community Edition component in the Xamarin Component Store. Code in the "FromFM" folder may need to be copied over again if you update to a new version of IceLink.
